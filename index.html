    <h3>Interesting thing about me...</h3>
    <p>I am still scared most of the time of what other people think of me and I don't really like to admit it but
    it really affects my mental health and takes up a large chunk of my time and energy just trying to deal
    with these emotions and battle the feeling of needing to constantly compare myself to everyone around me.
    I'm trying to better myself each and every day and will continue to strive to be the best version of myself.</p>
